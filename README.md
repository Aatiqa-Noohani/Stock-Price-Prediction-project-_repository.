📈 Stock Market Price Prediction Task
Aatiqa Attaullah

📌 Task Overview

This repository contains the completed Stock Market Price Prediction task assigned during my Dataset Internship at ARCH Technologies.
The task focuses on using historical stock market data to build a machine learning model capable of predicting future stock closing prices.

🎯 Objective

The objective of this task is to:

Analyze historical stock market data

Use relevant features to predict the next day’s closing price

Implement a complete machine learning workflow including preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and visualization

📂 Dataset Description

Dataset: Historical stock market data (Netflix – NFLX)

Data Type: Time-series

Features Used:

Open

High

Low

Close

Volume

Target Variable:

Next day Close price

🧠 Methodology

Loaded and cleaned the dataset

Converted date column to datetime and set it as index

Created a next-day prediction target using shifting

Applied chronological train-test split (80% training, 20% testing)

Scaled features using MinMaxScaler

Trained a Linear Regression model

Evaluated model performance using RMSE and R² score

Visualized actual vs predicted stock prices

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas & NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

📊 Evaluation Metrics

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) – measures prediction error

R² Score – evaluates model accuracy and fit

📈 Output

Predicted next-day stock closing prices

Graphical comparison of actual vs predicted values

Quantitative evaluation using regression metrics
